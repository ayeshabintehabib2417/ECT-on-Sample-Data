# Python Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset from Kaggle using Python with Pandas and NumPy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Student Performance in Exams** dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams).

## Steps
1. Set up Visual Studio Code with Python and install required packages (Pandas and NumPy).
2. Load and explore the dataset using Pandas.
3. Perform basic data analysis such as calculating averages and filtering top students based on performance.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how to work with a Kaggle dataset, apply EDA techniques, and use Python libraries to extract meaningful insights.
